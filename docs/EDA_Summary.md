# üè° House Price Prediction - EDA Summary & Conclusions

## üìä Overview
This document summarizes the findings from the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed on the Kaggle House Prices dataset. The insights from this EDA will inform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building in later stages.

## ‚úÖ **Key Findings from EDA**

### 1. **Feature Types & Distributions**
- The dataset contains a mix of **numerical** and **categorical** features.
- Key **numerical features** like `SalePrice`, `GrLivArea`, `LotArea`, `TotRmsAbvGrd` are right-skewed, indicating that transformations may be required (e.g., log or Box-Cox transformation).
- The **target variable `SalePrice`** is also right-skewed and leptokurtic, and will benefit from a **log transformation**.

---

### 2. **Missing Values**
- Several features have missing values:
  - **Categorical**: `PoolQC`, `MiscFeature`, `Alley`, etc., mostly indicating absence (NaN values).
  - **Numerical**: Features like `LotFrontage`, `GarageYrBlt`, etc., will require imputation (likely with medians or group-wise imputation).

### 3. **Correlations & Important Predictors**
- **Strong predictors of house prices**:
  - `OverallQual`, `GrLivArea`, `TotalBsmtSF`, `GarageCars`, `1stFlrSF`.
- **Top categorical features**:
  - `Neighborhood`, `ExterQual`, `KitchenQual`, `GarageFinish`, `BsmtQual`.
  - These categorical features show significant price differences across their levels.
- High correlations observed between features such as:
  - `GrLivArea` vs `TotRmsAbvGrd`.

---

### 4. **Outliers**
- Major outliers observed in:
  - `GrLivArea`, `LotFrontage`, `SalePrice`.
- **Outliers in `SalePrice`** were reviewed and may need removal or transformation.
- **Outliers in `GrLivArea`** could be addressed by removing extreme cases (very large living areas with low prices).

---

### 5. **Categorical Feature Importance**
- **Key Categorical Features** that affect house price:
  - `Neighborhood`: Major factor influencing prices.
  - `ExterQual`, `KitchenQual`, `BsmtQual`: High-quality attributes correlate with higher prices.
- Consider **target encoding** for features like `Neighborhood`.

---

### 6. **Neighborhood Insights**
- **Expensive neighborhoods**: `NoRidge`, `StoneBr`, `NridgHt`, etc.
- **Cheaper neighborhoods**: `MeadowV`, `IDOTRR`, etc.
- **Highly variable neighborhoods**: `Blmngtn`, `OldTown`, etc., indicating a broad price range.
- **Outlier-prone neighborhoods**: `NorthPark`, `Crawfor`, where prices tend to spike or dip.

---

### 7. **Interactions & Nonlinearities**
- Several features show evidence of **nonlinear relationships**:
  - `GrLivArea` and `OverallQual` exhibit nonlinear price effects.
  - **Threshold effects** observed with `GarageCars` where price increases but plateaus.
- Interactions between variables like `YearBuilt` and `SalePrice` are crucial and will be captured in modeling.

---

## üìå **Next Steps**
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove or transform outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Encode categorical features, create interaction terms, and normalize/scale continuous features.
- **Modeling**: Use the insights from EDA to build and validate regression models. We'll likely experiment with tree-based models and linear models.
